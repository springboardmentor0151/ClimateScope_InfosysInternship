MILESTONE 1 - WORK LOG
=======================

Project: Climatescope - Global Weather Analysis
Dataset: Global Weather Repository (Kaggle)
Period: November 2024

DATASET OVERVIEW
----------------
- Total Records: 107,573
- Geographic Coverage: 211 countries, 254 locations
- Temporal Range: May 2024 - November 2025 (18 months)
- Data Completeness: 100% (no missing values)
- Variables: 41 original columns + 6 engineered features

TASKS COMPLETED
---------------
1. Data Acquisition & Setup
   - Downloaded dataset from Kaggle
   - Set up project structure and virtual environment
   - Installed required dependencies (pandas, numpy, plotly, etc.)

2. Data Quality Assessment
   - Inspected all 41 columns and data types
   - Verified data completeness (0% missing values)
   - Checked for duplicates (none found)
   - Validated geographic and temporal coverage

3. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
   - Standardized column names (lowercase, underscores)
   - Engineered temporal features (year, month, day, hour)
   - Validated data ranges for key variables
   - Identified anomalies: 155 UV index outliers (0.14%)

4. Data Aggregation
   - Created daily country-level aggregates
   - Reduced dataset from 107,573 to 101,921 records
   - Calculated mean values for weather and air quality metrics

5. Exploratory Analysis
   - Generated comprehensive statistical summaries
   - Analyzed geographic distribution patterns
   - Assessed weather patterns and extremes
   - Evaluated air quality across regions

KEY FINDINGS
------------
Weather Patterns:
- Global average temperature: 22.54°C (σ = 8.88°C)
- Temperature extremes: -24.9°C (Ulaanbaatar) to 49.2°C (Kuwait City)
- Average humidity: 64.87%
- Precipitation observed in 33.6% of locations

Air Quality:
- 52.2% of locations have "Good" air quality (EPA Index 1)
- 31.9% have "Moderate" air quality (EPA Index 2)
- Average PM2.5: 25.29 μg/m³
- Highest pollution: Chile (181.88 μg/m³), Saudi Arabia (141.78 μg/m³)

NEXT STEPS (MILESTONE 2)
-------------------------
1. Develop interactive visualizations using Plotly
2. Create geographic heat maps with Folium
3. Build correlation analysis between variables
4. Design Streamlit dashboard for data exploration
5. Investigate and address data anomalies (wind speed outliers, negative PM10 values)

TECHNICAL NOTES
---------------
- All scripts are modular and reusable
- Code follows PEP 8 style guidelines
- Comprehensive docstrings for all functions
- Version control with Git (feature branch workflow)
- Ready for peer review and mentor feedback

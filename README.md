🌍 ClimateScope: Visualizing Global Weather Trends and Extreme Events

📌 Project Overview

ClimateScope is a data visualization project that analyzes and visually represents global weather patterns using the Global Weather Repository dataset. The project focuses on identifying seasonal trends, regional variations, and extreme weather events through interactive and insightful visualizations.
The dashboard enables users to explore climate behavior over time, compare weather conditions across regions, and detect anomalies using data-driven visual analytics.

🎯 Project Objective

The objective of ClimateScope is to:

Analyze global weather data collected worldwide
Identify seasonal patterns and long-term trends
Compare weather conditions across countries and regions
Detect extreme weather events and anomalies
Provide an interactive and accessible platform for climate awareness and analysis
